Zymplectic :: Cutting edge numerical integration done easy, fast, accurate and beautiful
- is a numerical integration platform intended for scientific and educational purposes.
- is non-intrusive and does not modify files outside its directory unless instructed to by the user.
- is an accurate and efficient engine for simulating dynamical systems using the largest existing library of symplectic integrators.
- works straight out of the box as it does not require any setup, installation or otherwise.
- includes a wide range of examples, that can be run by a single click in the application user interface.

How to use:
- Download Zymplectic (bundled with clang or gcc). Only win64 supported at this time
- Run Zymplectic.exe
- Start any of the included example c++ scripts or write your own Hamiltonian systems using provided templates
