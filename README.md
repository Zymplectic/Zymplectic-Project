## Zymplectic :: Cutting edge numerical integration done easy, fast, accurate and beautiful
- Numerical integration platform intended for scientific and educational purposes
- Highly accurate and efficient engine for simulating dynamical systems using the world's largest selection of symplectic integrators
- Non-intrusive, fully offline, requires no installation and does not modify files outside its directory
- Works straight out of the box (7z zip file) with no dependencies and requires no setup
- Includes more than 80 example dynamical systems to be compiled and run with a single click in a practical user interface

`Only win64 supported at this time. Integrator coefficients and Hamiltonian systems can otherwise be extracted from text files`

### How to use:
- Download Zymplectic (bundled with clang or gcc) and extract files to folder
- Run Zymplectic.exe
- Start any of the included example c++ scripts or write your own Hamiltonian systems using provided templates
