Zymplectic :: Cutting edge numerical integration done easy, fast, accurate and beautiful
- Numerical integration platform intended for scientific and educational purposes.
- Highly accurate and efficient engine for simulating dynamical systems using the largest existing library of symplectic integrators.
- Non-intrusive as it is fully offline and does not modify files outside its directory.
- Works straight out of the box (7z zip file) as it requires no setup, installation or otherwise.
- Includes around 50 examples that can be run by a single click in the graphical user interface.

How to use:
- Download Zymplectic (bundled with clang or gcc). Only win64 supported at this time
- Run Zymplectic.exe
- Start any of the included example c++ scripts or write your own Hamiltonian systems using provided templates
